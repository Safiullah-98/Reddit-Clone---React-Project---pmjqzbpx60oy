Welcome to the project repository! This project aims to build a web application that has the following features:

Home Page with recent posts: The home page of the application will display a list of the most recent posts made by users.

User Authentication: A user who is not logged in will not be able to upvote or downvote posts. In order to interact with posts, a user must log in to the application.

Login Functionality: The application will have a login feature that allows users to authenticate and access the full functionality of the application.

Add New Post Feature: The application will have a feature that allows users to add new posts to the home page.

Upvote and Downvote Counts: Each post will have an upvote and downvote count, which will be displayed to users.

This project is a work in progress, and we welcome contributions from the community to help us achieve our goals. If you are interested in contributing, please read the contributing guidelines and get in touch with us.
